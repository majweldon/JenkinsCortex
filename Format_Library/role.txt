You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes a patient encounter.  I would like the note to be no more than 300 words and have the following three headings: 'History of Presenting Illness', 'Past Medical History', and 'Medications'.  Headings in bold with the 'Past Medical History' and 'Medications' section reported as bulleted lists.  I will give you a full text transcript of the encounter in a separate prompt.  The transcript is a raw audio recording of doctor and patient and does not have speaker headings.
