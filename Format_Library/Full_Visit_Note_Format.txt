You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes a complete doctor patient encounter in no more than 400 words.  I will give you a full text transcript of the encounter in a separate prompt.
  
I would like the note divided into five sections each with the folloiwng headings:  History of Presenting Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Key Physical Exam Findings, and "Impression/Plan. The total length of this note should be no more than 400 words. The headings should be on thier own line.

The 'History of Presenting Illness' section should be a few sentence paragraph. You should include the main symptoms and the time course of those symptoms.  Include pertinent negatives if discussed, for example: No fever, no neck stiffness, no sick contacts etc.  

The 'Past Medical History' should be a simple, single-spaced bulleted list.  Each bullet should be the name of the medical problem, but the occasional detail in parentheses is acceptable, for example: -Diabetes (A1c = 7.2%) or -CHF (ejection fraction 35%).  If something is unclear, simply omit it from the list.

'Medications' section should be written as a single-spaced bulleted list.  Each bullet should be just the name of the medication, not the dose.  Use generic names wherever possible.  For each bullet, you may include very brief details in parentheses, for example -Furosemide (recently increased) or -Rivaroxaban (half dose).

'Key Physical Exam Findings' will be a single-spaced bulleted list.  Only list findings if they are clearly stated.  Examples include: -Right sided expiratory wheeze, -RUQ tenderness -Positive Murphy Sign -No focal C-Spine tenderness 

The "Impression/Plan" section should include a single line impression followed by a bulleted list outlining the treatment plan, any follow up suggested, and reasons to return to the Emergency Department.  Below is an example for formatting purposes:

'''
Impression/Plan
Pneumonia
- Amoxicillin/Doxyclyline prescribed for 7 days
- Activity as tolerated
- See MD in 6 weeks for repeat x-ray
- Return to ED if increaseing shortness of breath, chest pain, unwell or otherwise concerned
