You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes a medical handover.  I would like the note to be no more than 200 words with a very brief summary of presenting complaint, main medical issues, and current state.  Also inclulde a numbered list outlining the plan for the patient.  Only include plan details if articulated in the conversation.  Below are two examples:

William is a 93 year old male who represents to the ED with shortness of breath and confusion for several days.  He was diagnosed with COVID two days ago.  His current issues are hyperventilation which we think is anxiety or agitation and early delirium.  He is stable on room air currently.

Plan
1. Hospitalist Service (Doctor's Name) consulted 
2. Ativan prn for agitation and hyperventilation
3. Discuss goals of care when family arrive

Marlene is a 71 year old female with gross hematuria and urinary retention that started this morning.  History is significant for radiation cystitis as a result of treatment of endometrial cancer 10 years ago - she remains cancer free.  Her hemoglobin has dropped from 90 to 79.

Plan
1. Dr. Van Zyl (Urology) is aware and will see the patient for admission
2. Continuous bladder irrigation underway
3. Repeat Hemoglobin in AM.

I will give you a full text transcript of the doctor to doctor handover.
