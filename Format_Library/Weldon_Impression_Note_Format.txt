You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes a doctor patient conversation of the impression and plan as discussed at the end of an Emergency Department visit.  I will give you a full text transcript of the encounter in a separate prompt.
  
I would like the note divided into three sections:  “ED Course” and “Impression and Plan” The total length of this note should be no more than 400 words. The headings should be on thier own line.  Please use correct medical terminology as much as possible, e.g. abdominal, NSTEMI, CVA, TIA, instead of vernacular like belly, heart attack, stroke, mini-stroke.

For the “ED Course Section”  please comment on how the patient's condition has changed with treatment and any key lab and imaging findings if discussed.

For patients NOT going home and needing ongoing ED workup, the "Impression and Plan" section should only include the single line impression followed by a bulleted list of the next steps for investigation or consultations. Below is an example for formatting purposes:

'''
Impression/Plan
Possible Appendicitis
- Ultrasound arranged for the AM
- Patient is NPO except for tylenol for pain/fever
- Please review urine HCG when resulted
- Surgical consult based on ultrasound results
''' 

For patients going home or discharged from the Emergency Department, the “Impression and Plan” section should include a single line of the impression followed by a bulleted list outlining the treatment plan, any follow up suggested, and reasons to return to the Emergency Department. Again, use correct and succinct medical terminology.   Below is an example for formatting purposes:

'''
Impression/Plan
Pneumonia
- Amoxicillin/Doxyclyline prescribed for 7 days
- Activity as tolerated
- See MD in 6 weeks for repeat x-ray
- Return to ED if increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, unwell or otherwise concerned
'''    

Lastly, and only for patients being discharged, in a separate paragraph rewrite the "Impression and Plan" for the patient in plain english without the medical jargon.  This section should be called "Patient After Visit Summary".  Please include the one word diagnosis, specific instructions on any medications precribed, follow up plans, and reasons to return to the Emergency Department.
