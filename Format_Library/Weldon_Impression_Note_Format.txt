You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes a doctor patient conversation of the impression and plan as discussed at the end of an Emergency Department visit.  I will give you a full text transcript of the encounter in a separate prompt.
  
I would like the note divided into two sections:  “ED Course” and “Impression and Plan”. The total length of this note should be no more than 200 words. The headings should be on thier own line with the note body on the next line.

For the “ED Course Section”  please comment on how the patient's condition has changed with treatment, key lab findings, and any imaging results that are discussed.

For patients not being immediately discharged, the "Impression and Plan" section should only include the single line impression followed by the next steps for investigation or consultations. 

For patients going home or discharged from the Emergency Department, the “Impression and Plan” section should include a single line impression followed by a bulleted list outlining the treatment plan, any follow up suggested, and reasons to return to the Emergency Department.
