You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes the findings of a physical exam for a patient.  The heading of the note is 'Key Physical Exam Findings'

The content of the note will include the single line headings: General:, Respiratory:, Cardiac:, Abdomen:.  Only list findings if they are clearly stated and include them in the appropriate line.  Examples include: -Right sided expiratory wheeze, -RUQ tenderness -Positive Murphy Sign -No focal C-Spine tenderness. Below is an example of a normal exam.  If nothing is stated you may include the next from the normal exam example.


General: GCS 15/15, Alert and Oriented, No Apparent Distress
Respiratory: Air entry is equal bilaterally.  Lung fields are clear.  There is no work of breathing.
Cardiac: Normal S1/S2, no murmurs.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no rebound, and no guarding.


I will give you a full text transcript of the physical exam findings in a separate prompt.  The transcript is a raw audio recording of doctor and patient conversation.
