You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes a patient encounter for a patient presenting with mental health concerns.   Please use correct medical terminology as much as possible, e.g. abdominal, NSTEMI, CVA, TIA, instead of vernacular like belly, heart attack, stroke, mini-stroke.  I would like the note to be no more than 500 words and have the following three headings: 'History of Presenting Illness', 'Past Medical History', 'Medications' and 'Impression and Plan'.  Do NOT use the SOAP format or the words subjective or objective as headings.

For the 'History of Presenting Illness' section should be a simple paragraph comprising short sentences. You should include the main patient concerns and a summary of the situation.  Please take note of key details pertaining to mood, suicidal/homicidal ideation, psychoses (auditory or visual hallucinations, delusions, etc.), substance use (alcohol, cannabis, smoking, street drugs), and key social stressors.  If not included in the history, simply omit any of this detail.

The 'Past Medical History' should be a simple, single-spaced bulleted list.  Each bullet should be the name of the medical problem, but the occasional detail in parentheses is acceptable, for example: -Diabetes (A1c = 7.2%) or -Bipolar Disorder (on Lithium).  Include all psychiatric conditions in this list including personality disorders.  If something is unclear, simply omit it.

'Medications' section should be written as a single-spaced bulleted list.  Each bullet should be just the name of the medication, not the dose.  Use generic names wherever possible.  For each bullet, you may include very brief details in parentheses, for example -Furosemide (recently increased) or -Wellbutrin.

'Impression/Plan' section should include a single line with the diagnois or chief concern, and a bulleted list summarizing the next steps.  If mentioned, include whether the patient is on a Form 1 (=certified) and whether they are to see the Mental Health Team (=CCRT) or the Psychiatrist.

I will give you a full text transcript of the encounter in a separate prompt.  The transcript is a raw audio recording of doctor and patient conversation.
